Team HARP -- 2016 Amazon Picking Challenge
==========================================

## Harp Perception

The harp perception package runs item identification and localization algorithms used in the 2016 Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). The task was given a known list of item, including target items, remove target items from the shelf and place them in the tote. Each shelf bin may contain up to 10 items and some items may be partially occluded. All development was done in ROS using caffe, PCL, and openCV.
